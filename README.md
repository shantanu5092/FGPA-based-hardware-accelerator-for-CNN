# FGPA-based-hardware-accelerator-for-CNN
The project aims to develop a hardware accelerator for CNN. The design of the hardware accelerator will be based upon the bit scalable architecture. The expectation is to see increase in the throughput and accuracy of the new model in comparison to the standard model.
